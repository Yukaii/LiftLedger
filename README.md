# Lift Ledger: A Simple Fitness Tracking Format

Lift Ledger is a plain text format for tracking fitness workouts and progress over time. It's designed to be easy to edit manually while also being parser-friendly and extensible.

It's inspired by [beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount). Co-designed with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

## Key Features

- Simple, human-readable plain text format
- Easy to edit manually or with basic text editors
- Structured for easy parsing by programs
- Flexible organization (by day, week, month, or year)
- Supports exercise definitions, workout templates, and logging
- Accommodates incomplete sets and workout notes

## Format Explanation

- Lines starting with ';' are comments
- '@exercises' section defines exercises with details
- '@template' defines workout templates
- Date lines start workouts, measurements, or personal records
- '*' indicates a workout, '#' measurements, '^' personal records
- Exercise logs: `Name: Weight Reps @RPE "Optional notes"`
- Reps can be noted as `5x3` for consistent sets or `5/5/4` for varying reps
- Use "BW" for bodyweight exercises

## Extensibility

The format is designed to be extended by third-party tools. Special comments (e.g., '; @tool-specific-instruction') can be used for custom features but are ignored by the core parser.
